== Creating the test database

The default name for the test databases is "acts_as_dropdown_plugin_test". If you 
want to use another database name then be sure to update the database name with the
database you want to test with in test/connection.rb. 
If you are using MySQL, you can import the schema file found at test/fixtures/mysql.sql.

== Running by hand

Unit tests are located in the test directory. To execute the test do the following:

   ruby dropdown_test.rb
   
This will execute the test with the information found in the connection.rb file.
